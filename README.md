# SQL Projects Repository  

This repository contains both **individual** and **group** SQL projects showcasing database creation, data insertion, analysis, and query execution. The group project also includes **Power BI visuals** for presenting insights.

##  Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL** (MySQL)  
- **Power BI** (for group project visualization)

##  Project Overview  

### **Group Project**  
- **Created a database** from scratch.
